# Changelog

Notable changes to this repository's skill are recorded here. Historical entries
below are source-project history from `dakshagrawa/hermes-workflows`; Media Scout
entries describe a separate project, now maintained at
[`dakshagrawa/media-scout`](https://github.com/dakshagrawa/media-scout), and do
not mean those files remain in this repository.

## Unreleased

- Prepare the existing repository and `production-web-checklist` package for the
  parent-managed slug rename to `dakshagrawa/production-web-checklist`; clarify
  the Media Scout project split without replacing this repository's history.

### Native Media Scout 0.2.0

- Extend the same evidence/review workflow to YouTube, Threads, TikTok,
  public Snapchat, X/Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Vimeo and Bluesky alongside
  Instagram, with strict content-URL allowlists and platform-namespaced identity.
- Preserve legacy Instagram hashes/receipts. Keep opaque share links provisional
  and distinguish source URL recognition from verified live acquisition.
- Add optional platform-specific thread titles through the consent-gated native
  platform-action facade, without core patches or wider bot permissions.
- Support actual text-only evidence without falsely requiring video/audio.
  Naming failure does not block intake or review; one item stays bound per thread.

### Native Media Scout 0.1.0

- Add a Linux-scoped native plugin and bundled `media-scout:workflow` skill,
  using documented Hermes >=0.22.6 admission, storage and tool APIs.
- Move trusted receipt creation, durable extraction claims, bounded evidence
  persistence and native review handoff into executable bookkeeping.
- Preserve permanent summaries and source/task links; make owned artifact
  retention separately opt-in with bounded, drift-checked plans.
- Keep real media extraction and personalized reasoning in admitted native
  tools and reviewer profiles. No extra service, second bot, core override,
  silent dependency installation or live-profile migration is included.
- Publish native SDK qualification separately from actual Discord/model/media
  acceptance. Existing skills and instruction-only workflow paths are unchanged.

- Fix false media-intake blockers in `media-evidence-library` 0.1.1: look up
  auto-thread starter messages in the actual parent channel; treat an exact
  missing catalog record as the creation path and continue in the same run.
  Add source-provenance guidance and an offline regression contract. No broader
  Discord permissions or new custom runtime code is required.

- Require only the Python 3.10 and 3.13 Ubuntu jobs for normal changes. Preserve
  macOS/Windows coverage through manual workflow dispatch, with unchanged pinned
  actions, read-only workflow permissions and the full contract test suite.

- Rename the same public repository from `agent-skills` to `hermes-workflows`,
  preserving existing skill paths, Git history and contributor attribution.
- Add portable `media-evidence-library` 0.1.0, Media Scout workflow templates,
  source-attributed learning/review contracts, an HTML diagram and acceptance
  boundaries. Public defaults remain inactive until local owner authorization.
- Archive the optional base-specific native naming patch with integrity metadata
  and the upstream license; no automatic patch application or runtime service.
- Add offline contracts for privacy, inert defaults, links, patch provenance and
  workflow safety. No private runtime data is included.

- Extend `production-web-checklist` with source-backed AI-assisted website
  brief requirements, anti-slop specificity, launch-detail state coverage,
  crawlable-rendering checks, and explicit pre-launch security verification for
  SEO, performance, legal, and security guidance from public creator sources.
- Preserve both requested Instagram source URLs and do not infer guidance beyond
  their recovered caption and user-provided transcript evidence.
- Add recovered caption and transcript guidance from the two requested reels:
  legal-risk checks for age-sensitive signup, fonts, session replay, marketing
  email, subscriptions, and DMCA process, plus explicit SEO checks for
  sitemaps, robots, noindex, canonicals, metadata, headings, alt text, schema,
  links, image compression, Core Web Vitals, mobile behavior, HTTPS, URL slugs,
  OG images, Search Console, and ethical backlinks.
- Extend `production-web-checklist` with contextual design-brief guidance and
  architecture-aware login/authentication review informed by two additional
  Instagram sources. The design post page itself was not extractable, but its
  transcript was supplied by the user; the login post's five audit items remain
  unavailable and are not invented.
- Incorporate the user-provided transcript for the design post into the source
  evidence and anti-pattern checklist, interpreting “no demo,” “no loaders,” and
  “no policies” as missing essentials to address contextually, not as features
  to remove.

- Tune `production-web-checklist` for Hermes Agent with native tool selection,
  skill discovery, clarification, bounded delegation, secure browser
  authentication, toolset-availability handling, and explicit approval/read-back
  gates for external side effects. Preserve all prior workflow content and bump
  the skill package to 0.4.0.

## 0.1.0

- Initial publication of `production-web-checklist`.
- Establish repository documentation, contribution guidance, security policy,
  automated tests, and cross-platform CI.
- Restore precise design, copy, SEO, legal, security, accessibility,
  conversion, performance, and output requirements with evidence-based
  verification and safe-content boundaries.
- Add regression coverage so future edits cannot silently generalize the
  checklist's concrete requirements away.
